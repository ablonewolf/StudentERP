# StudentERP
This is a full-stack ERP project.

The front-end part of this application was developed using React with JavaScript and Bootstrap for styling. 
The Back-end part of this application was developed with Spring Boot with Java. For DBMS, I have used MySQL.

This application includes:
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Dynamic role management.
- Managing users dynamically.
- Role-based activities.

I have developed this application to demonstrate my skill as a full-stack web application developer.
